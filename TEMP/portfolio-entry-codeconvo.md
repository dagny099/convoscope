## ü§ñ AI Chat Interface & Analysis Tool

### Description
A Streamlit-based application that enables interactive conversations with Large Language Models (supporting multiple LLM providers) while providing tools for conversation management and analysis. The interface allows users to configure their LLM interactions, save chat histories, and generate topic summaries of their conversations. Serve the application from a remote server and make it accessible from a custom domain that I own.  The tool transforms standard AI chat interactions into a structured, analyzable format with built-in topic extraction and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Interaction**: Implemented streaming responses using async Python for fluid conversations
- **Conversation Management**: Built a robust system for saving, loading, and auto-recovering chat histories
- **Analytics Engine**: Integrated OpenAI's GPT models for automated topic extraction and conversation analysis
- **Export System**: Created a custom HTML report generator with embedded styling and responsive design
- **Configurable Interface**: Developed a dynamic settings system for LLM parameters, display options, and UI customization

### Technical Highlights
- Architected an asynchronous streaming system for real-time AI responses
- Implemented state management using Streamlit's session state
- Designed a flexible JSON-based conversation storage system
- Created a modular system for supporting multiple LLM providers
- Built custom HTML/CSS templates for beautiful report generation

### Skills Demonstrated
