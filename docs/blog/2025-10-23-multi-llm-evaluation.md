# Why Multi‑LLM Evaluation Matters

Most demos show a single model answering a single prompt. That’s not how real work feels. When you compare multiple models side‑by‑side on the same prompt, you start to see patterns: tone, structure, depth, and where each model shines or struggles.

## The Big Idea
- Ask the same question once.
- See 2–4 model responses next to each other.
- Score them quickly while identities are hidden.
- Reveal who wrote what after you’ve formed an opinion.

This workflow builds intuition and trust. It also produces a lightweight dataset you can revisit and re‑score later.

## What We Value
- Transparency: Blind by default. Append‑only logs. Clear labeling of estimates.
- Relevance: Prompts come from relatable domains (biology, cognitive science, sports, everyday life) so non‑technical readers can judge quality.
- Repeatability: Save results to JSONL. Use prompt sets to rerun later.

## A Few Prompts We Like
- Biology: “Explain how vaccines train the immune system using everyday analogies.”
- Cognitive Science: “Describe working memory with a daily‑life example and one improvement strategy.”
- Sports: “Coach a beginner on pacing for a 5K with a simple week plan.”
- Everyday: “Two ways to remember names at a party—compare with pros/cons.”

These aren’t trivia tests; they’re judgment calls. That’s the point. You can tell when a response is useful, kind, and clear.

## What We Record
- Latency, estimated tokens, and estimated cost (from a transparent pricing table).
- Status and errors (so one failure doesn’t sink the whole run).
- Human scores: correctness, usefulness, clarity, safety, overall.

## Where This Goes Next
- Batch runs with prompt tags.
- Preference‑based rankings (A beats B) you can aggregate later.
- Optional “LLM‑as‑judge” with careful bias controls (off by default).

Multi‑LLM evaluation isn’t about a leaderboard. It’s about better judgment and better choices—making model behavior legible so people can pick the right tool for the task.
